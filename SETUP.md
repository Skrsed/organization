#### Step 2: Create a New Organization

1. After signing in, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
2. Select "Your Organizations."
3. Click on the "New organization" button.
4. Fill in the organization name, choose "Free plan," and follow the prompts to create the organization.

#### Step 3: Configure Organization Settings

1. Navigate to your new organization's page.
2. Click on "Settings" and then "Member privileges" to set permissions.

   - Set repositories to "Private" for enhanced security.
   - Allow repository forking by checking the option for "Allow members to fork the repository."
   - Set project base permissions to "No permission"
   - Forbid pages creation to enhance control over project documentation.

#### Step 4: Create Private Repositories

1. In the organization, go to the "Repositories" tab.
2. Click "New" to create private repositories for your projects.
3. Ensure to select "Private" during repository creation.
4. To add existing repositories to the organization:

   - Navigate to the organization's page.
   - Click on "Repositories" and then "New repository."
   - Choose "Import repository" from the options.
   - Provide the repository's clone URL and follow the prompts to complete the import.
   - Don't forget to set your organization as owner.

   This allows you to bring in existing repositories into the organization seamlessly.

#### Step 5: Set Up Teams

Establishing a well-organized team structure is crucial for effective collaboration. Follow the steps below to set up teams within your GitHub organization:

1. In the organization, go to "Teams" under "Settings."

2. Create the following teams for better organization and access control:

   - **Shared Team:**
      - Create a team named "Shared Team" to serve as a centralized hub for organization-wide documentation.
      - This team focuses on sharing information and does not directly manage repositories.

   - **Core Team:**
      - Create a team named "Core Team," a child of the "Shared Team."
      - Populate the "Core Team" with core development team members.
      - Grant this team write access to all repositories to facilitate seamless collaboration.
      - This team ensures the core developers have the necessary permissions.

   - **Individual Developers Team:**
      - Create a team named "Individual Developers Team," a child of the "Shared Team."
      - This team is specifically for outside developers but doesn't grant access to repositories.
      - Use this team for structural purposes, providing a clear distinction from the core development team.

   - **Project Teams (Multiple Teams for Each Project):**
      - For each project, create a dedicated team (e.g., "Project A Team," "Project B Team"), each a child of the "Shared Team."
      - Populate project teams with relevant members for the specific project.
      - Grant write access to the repositories associated with each project.
      - This approach isolates project visibility, allowing fine-grained control over access and collaboration.

This team structure ensures an organized and secure collaboration environment, with dedicated teams for documentation, core development, individual developers, and project-specific access.

#### Step 6: Invite Team Members

1. In the organization, go to "Teams" and select team corresponding to the new member role.
2. Click "Add member" and enter team members' email addresses or usernames.
3. For cases where specific individuals require access to a single repository (e.g. Individual Developers Team):
   - Navigate to the repository settings.
   - In the "Manage access" section, add individuals directly with the appropriate permissions.

Congratulations! Your GitHub organization is set up for collaboration.
