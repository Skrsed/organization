#### Step 1: Sign Up for a GitHub Account

- Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a new account using your company email.

#### Step 2: Create a New Organization

1. After signing in, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
2. Select "Your Organizations."
3. Click on the "New organization" button.
4. Fill in the organization name, choose "Free plan," and follow the prompts to create the organization.

#### Step 3: Configure Organization Settings

1. Navigate to your new organization's page.
2. Click on "Settings" and then "Member privileges" to set permissions.

   - Set repositories to "Private" for enhanced security.
   - Allow repository forking by checking the option for "Allow members to fork the repository."
   - Set project base permissions to "Read."
   - Forbid pages creation to enhance control over project documentation.

#### Step 4: Invite Team Members

1. In the organization, go to "People" under "Settings."
2. Click "Invite member" and enter team members' email addresses or usernames.
3. Set their role and send invitations.

#### Step 5: Create Private Repositories

1. In the organization, go to the "Repositories" tab.
2. Click "New" to create private repositories for your projects.
3. Ensure to select "Private" during repository creation.
4. To add existing repositories to the organization:

   - Navigate to the organization's page.
   - Click on "Repositories" and then "New repository."
   - Choose "Import repository" from the options.
   - Provide the repository's clone URL and follow the prompts to complete the import.
   - Don't forget to set your organization as owner.

   This allows you to bring in existing repositories into the organization seamlessly.

#### Step 6: Set Up Teams

1. In the organization, go to "Teams" under "Settings."
2. Create the following teams for better organization and access control:

   - **Core Developers:**
     - Click "New team."
     - Name the team "Core Developers."
     - Add core development team members.
     - Set repository access to "Write" for this team.

   - **Outside Developers:**
     - Click "New team."
     - Name the team "Outside Developers."
     - Add external or contracted developers.
     - Set repository access to "Read" for this team.

   - **Administrators:**
     - Click "New team."
     - Name the team "Administrators."
     - Add key administrators and managers.
     - Assign the "Administrator" role to this team for full repository access and administrative tasks.

3. Note: Scaling for single Repository or group of Repositories:

   - As your organization grows, you may need to replicate this team structure for each repository or group of related repositories.

   - Consider creating repository-specific teams with corresponding access levels to maintain a scalable and organized structure.

   - Utilize parent repositories for setting base access permissions or storing shared resources across related repositories.

    > **E.g.** "Core Developers" <- "Specific Repository"

4. Note: Owners adding Users to Repositories separately from Teams:
   
   - Owners have the ability to add users directly to repositories, separate from team assignments.
   - This flexibility allows for fine-grained control over individual repository access.
   - For users added individually to repositories, consider creating a separate team (e.g., "Individual Contributors") with minimal base access to ensure consistency and easy management.

5. Assign team members to their respective teams and define repository access levels based on their roles.

#### Step 7: Reviewing and Merging

1. When changes are deemed ready, use GitHub's "Merge" button to integrate them into the development branch.
2. Periodically, synchronize the development branch by merging it into the main/prod branch to maintain the latest features and fixes.



Congratulations! Your GitHub organization is set up for collaboration.
